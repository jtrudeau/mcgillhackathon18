# Introduction to Arduino: McGill Hackathon 2018
Resources for Introduction to Arduino Workshop.

What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source hardware and software electronics platform. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending instructions to the microcontroller on the board. This is done with the Arduino programming language (basically C++ with specific libraries), and the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is based on Processing.

Simple instructions for getting started:

1. Install Arduino IDE or use the web editor:

# Introduction to Arduino: McGill Hackathon 2018
Resources for Introduction to Arduino Workshop.

What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (basically C++ with specific libraries), and the Arduino Software (IDE), (based on Processing).

Simple instructions for getting started:

1. Install Arduino IDE or use the web editor:
